'''
Simiar to part 1, create a function that takes in two numbers a, b, and c. However, this dictionary should have all the numbers between a and b (inclusive) as keys, and whether they are prime as the values. Using this dictionary, output whether c is a prime number between a and b.

For this, you should use the separate function primes_dict to ouput the dictionary, so you can use the primes_dict function in part 3.

E.g.: if a = 1, b = 100, c = 6, then output False because 6 is not prime and it is between a = 1 and b = 100.

if a = 1, b = 100, c = 59, then output True because 59 is a prime number between 1 and 100.

if a = 1, b = 50, c = 59, then output False. While 59 is a prime number, it is not between a = 1 and b = 50.
